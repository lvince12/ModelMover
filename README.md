# ModelMover

Developed with Unreal Engine 5. Used to test how to move a skeletal mesh using coordinates. The project includes an inverse kinematics control rig that I built which can be used to get transform data and move the model. Currently, there is five keypoints which are the head, left hand, right hand, left foot and right foot.
